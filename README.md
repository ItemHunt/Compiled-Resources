# Compiled-Resources
## Introduction
Compiled-Resources is a minor side project which started because of my habit of creating cheatsheets, documentation, and learning resource lists to enhance my understanding of a topic I am currently studying or to take note of paths I can take in the future to advance my learnings. 

The objective of the project is to help others become better programmers  through the use of the cheatsheets and documentations present in this repository as well as provide ideas on what things they can study in the future to become better versions of themselves. 

## How to Contribute
For now, I will not accept any contributions to the project. I need to review, understand, and figure out some things first before contributions will be allowed to this project. It will be awhile before contributions will be accepted. No specific date.  

## Notice
Please note that this project is considered a minor side project. It will not receive active and regular support. It will only receive updates every now and then, meaning there will be no fixed update schedule.
